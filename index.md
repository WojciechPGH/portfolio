# Hello, I'm Wojtek

Hi, I'm Wojciech Paluch, a novice Unity developer who thrives on creativity and problem-solving. My journey in game development began with a fascination for how games are made, leading me to explore Unity and C#. Since then, I've created several small games, focusing on everything from gameplay mechanics to level design. Each project is a step towards mastering the craft, and I'm excited to share my progress and passion with you.
