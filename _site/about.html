<p>IT student, cat owner, volleyball enthusiast (both playing and cheering national team). 
Games and book lover, especially polish fantasy (Witcher, Achaja, Inquisytor saga). I live in small city near Lublin in Poland.
My adventure with game programming began in middle school. My mother bought me for my birthday <code class="highlighter-rouge">Flash 5</code> bible. I learnt a lot from that book,
especially about programming. I just fell in love with it. Seeing the process of building something out of almost nothing feel amazing! 
After year or two my attention was drawn to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Game Maker</code>. Ease of making games with it was astonishing. Also huge polish Game Maker community
was a big help. After months of learning <code class="highlighter-rouge">GML</code> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameMaker_Studio#GameMaker_Language" target="_blank">GameMaker Language</a>)
I was able to help other community members with <code class="highlighter-rouge">GML</code> related problems. Then highschool came. I chose class with with a mathematical and physical profile,
no computer science sadly. Fortunately we had variety of extracurricular activities. We were learning basics algorithms and also <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pascal</code>, which turned out to be
super useful during matriculation exam in computer science (got 88%). After highschool somehow I started to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Unity3D</code> (it was either beceause I got bored
with the Game Maker or I wanted to learn more professional programming language, or maybe both). At start it was quite hard to learn Unity since it has much
steeper learning curve than Game Maker, however every small success was super satisfying and kept me motivated for next challenges.</p>
